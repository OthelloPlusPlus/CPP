**Score:** 100%
> "Everything works as it should and the attention to detail and aesthetics is just amazing! (Which is no surprise :)) You really know your code and were able to explain the choices you made. Also, when we had a little weird situation, you immediately discovered what it was (it had nothing to do with the code). Good job!"
