# Exercises
## Exercise 00 - BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ
This exercise is desgined to demonstrate the use of stack and heap in C++. You are required to create a simple [Zombie class](ex00/Zombie.hpp) and intialise it in different methods. Demonstrating the [scope](ex00/randomChump.cpp) in which a class allocated on the **stack** exists and the keywords [new](ex00/newZombie.cpp#L22) and [delete](ex00/main.cpp#L62) which allocate and free objects on the **heap**.

## Exercise 01 - Moar brainz!
This excersize expands on the first exercise by demonstrating how allocate objects in an array on the **heap**. This is done by adding [] to the use of [new](ex01/zombieHorde.cpp#L28) and [delete](ex01/main.cpp#L60).

**Score:** 100%
> "Everything works as it should and the attention to detail and aesthetics is just amazing! (Which is no surprise :)) You really know your code and were able to explain the choices you made. Also, when we had a little weird situation, you immediately discovered what it was (it had nothing to do with the code). Good job!"
